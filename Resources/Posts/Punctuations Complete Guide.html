        <h2>PUNCTUATIONS</h2>
        <p>These are symbols used to clarify reading. They help to prevent misinterpretation of passages and show how the idea of the passage is conveyed. 
        Each punctuation has a function that we must understand to be able to use them properly in sentences.
        Examples of punctuations: <a href="#comma">Comma</a>, <a href="#colon">Colon</a>, <a href="#dash">Dash</a>, <a href="#scolon">Semicolon</a>, <a href="#period">Period</a>, and <a href="#apos">Apostrophe</a>.
        Let's go on to talk about them (A video guide to this post has been posted here).
        </p>
        <h4 id="comma">Comma (,)</h4>
        <p>This is one of the most used punctuations in the English Language (if not the most used). 
        It helps to identify a pause in reading, preventing run-offs when reading. 
        Let's discuss its uses below:
        <ol>
            <li>
                To separate items in a list<br>
                This is a well-known use of a comma, but you should note that it is only used in lists that contain three or more items.<br>
                <u>Example:</u><br>
                Chad has a cat, and a dog. ✖<br>
                Chad has a cat and a dog. ✔<br>
                Chad has a cat a dog and a friend. ✖<br>
                Chad has a cat, a dog, and a friend. ✔
            </li><br>
            <li>
                To separate two adjectives that can be separated by the word, "and".<br>
                You have to know that an adjective is any word that qualifies a noun or a pronoun. 
                This is different from an adverb; an adverb is used to modify a verb, and adjective, and even another adverb.<br>
                <u>Example:</u><br>
                Chadashiel says nice inspiring things. ✖<br>
                Chadashiel says nice and inspiring things. ✔<br>
                Chadashiel says nice, inspiring things. ✔<br>
                Chadashiel says nicely inspiring things. ✔ <br>
                <u>Note:</u> Here, the word, "nicely" is and adverb modifying "inspiring" (an adjective), so there's no need for a comma or the word, "and" to separate them.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                After transition words or phrases<br>
                Using a comma after transitions help the text sound more readable.<br>
                <u>Example:</u><br>
                Still the Vaticans were victorious. ✖<br>
                Still, the Vaticans were victorious. ✔
            </li><br>
            <li>
                To separate dependent and independent clauses<br>
                A dependent clause is a clause that can't stand on its own, meaning it makes no sense on its own. 
                An independent clause is a clause that can stand on ts own, meaning it makes complete sense on its own.<br>
                <u>For instance:</u><br>
                In the night - dependent clause<br>
                I will come - independent clause<br>
                You must also know that this function of a comma only works when the dependent clause comes directly before the independent clause in the sentence.<br>
                <u>Example:</u><br>
                In the night I will come. ✖<br>
                In the night, I will come. ✔<br>
                I will come in the night. ✔<br>
                Note that in the last sentence, no comma was needed because the independent clause came before the dependent clause.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                To show non-essential clauses in a sentence<br>
                Non-essential clauses are unnecessary parts of a sentence that just add more information to the sentence, meaning the sentence does not need them to make complete sense. 
                They can be place at the beginning, middle, or end of a sentence.<br>
                <u>Example:</u><br>
                The Pacific Ocean which is the largest ocean covers approximately 155 million square kilometers. ✖<br>
                The Pacific Ocean, which is the largest ocean, covers approximately 155 million square kilometers. ✔<br>
                This blog is written by Chadashiel an excellent person. ✖<br>
                This blog is written by Chadashiel, an excellent person. ✔<br>
                However they passed. ✖<br>
                However, they passed. ✔<br>
                You notice that in this last sentence, we said a comma should be after the transition word, "however". 
                This is because transition words are non-essential: they just help us connect one sentence to the sentence before it.<br>
                <u>Note:</u> The word, "that" doesn't introduce non-essential clauses, meaning a clause that starts with "that" is always essential.<br>
                Note that this doesn't mean that every group of words surrounded by two commas in a sentence in non-essential. You have to understand the context of the sentence.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                To separate two independent clauses<br>
                The comma works with the Coordinating Conjunctions (FANBOYS) to do this.<br>
                FANBOYS: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so<br>
                <u>Example:</u><br>
                Jessica fixed the laptop and she sold it. ✖<br>
                Jessica fixed the laptop, and she sold it. ✔<br>
                Jessica fixed the laptop and sold it. ✔<br>
                Note that in the last example, no comma was needed because the subject of the second clause ("she") was removed, making that clause to no longer be independent.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                To separate a name from its title<br>
                When the title comes directly before the name, no comma is used, but when the title comes directly after the name, a comma would be used.<br>
                <u>Example:</u><br>
                Famous and renowned painter, Chad, will always be in our hearts. ✖<br>
                Famous and renowned painter Chad will always be in our hearts. ✔<br>
                Chad, a famous and renowned painter, will always be in our hearts. ✔<br>
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <h2 id="colon">Colon (:)</h2>
        <p>
            This punctuation is just practically used to put more information in a sentence. 
            You must note that the statement before the colon must be an independent clause, and the word after the colon must start with a lowercase letter except the word is a proper noun.<br>
            Let's go through the functions of a colon:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    To introduce a list<br>
                    A colon can be used to attach a list to a sentence. 
                    However, you must note that a colon doesn't work with introductory words or phrases (like, such as...).<br>
                    <u>Example:</u><br>
                    The SAT tests two subjects English and Math. ✖<br>
                    The SAT tests two subjects: English and Math ✔<br>
                    Chad owns cool items such as: cars, phones, and bags. ✖<br>
                    Chad owns cool items such as cars, phones, and bags. ✔<br>
                    Chad owns cool items: cars, phones, and bags. ✔
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    To introduce an explanation<br>
                    Just like a colon can attach a list, it can be used to attach an explanation to a sentence. 
                    You must note that the statement after the colon must be providing more details or an explanation to the statement before the colon (in short, the two statements must be related).<br>
                    <u>Example:</u><br>
                    Sia wore a beautiful dress: Chad wore a cool jacket. ✖<br>
                    Sia wore a beautiful dress: it was white. ✔<br>
                    Sia wore a beautiful dress: white. ✔
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h2 id="dash">Dash (—)</h2>
        <p>
            In my opinion, this punctuation does not really have a function of its own; rather, it helps to work in place of a comma or a colon in some cases.<br>
            Let's explore the functions of a dash:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    To show non-essential clauses<br>
                    To perform this function, a dash works just the same way a comma works; the only difference is that the dash cannot be used to show a non-essential clause placed at the beginning of the sentence. It can, however, be used for non-essential clauses placed at the middle or end of a sentence, but most times, it's used for those placed at the missle of a sentence. 
                    Also, take note that a space is not put before or after the dash, when typing or writing.<br>
                    <u>Example:</u><br>
                    The Pacific Ocean, which is the largest ocean, covers approximately 155 million square kilometers. ✔<br>
                    The Pacific Ocean—the largest ocean—covers approximately 155 million square kilometres.✔<br>
                    The Pacific Ocean—which is the largest ocean—covers approximately 155 million square kilometers. ✔
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    To introduce a list<br>
                    To perform this function, a dash works the same way a colon works.<br>
                    <u>Example:</u><br>
                    The SAT tests two subject: English and Math. ✔<br>
                    The SAT tests two subject—English and Math. ✔
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    To introduce an explanation<br>
                    To perform this function, a dash works just like a colon.<br>
                    <u>Example:</u><br>
                    Sia wore a beautiful dress: it was white. ✔<br>
                    Sia wore a beautiful dress—it was white. ✔<br>
                    Sia wore a beautiful dress—white. ✔
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h2 id="scolon">Semicolon (;)</h2>
        <p>
            This punctuation is used to separate two independent clauses.<br>
            Now, unlike a comma, it can do this on its own. 
            You must note that the clause after the semicolon must start with a lowercase letter except it is a proper noun.<br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>
            Chad is smart; He is also nice. ✖<br>
            Chad is smart; he is also nice. ✔
        </p>
        <h2 id="period">Period (.)</h2>
        <p>
            This punctuation is also used to separate two sentences. 
            You must note that the sentence after a period must start with an uppercase letter under all circumstances (The Period is the only punctuation with this attribute). You must also note that while a sentence is always independent, so a semicolon and a period can be used interchangeably. 
            It's just that the end of a sentence can only be marked with a period.<br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>
            Chad is smart. he is also nice. ✖<br>
            Chad is smart. He is also nice. ✔
        </p>
        <h2 id="apos">Apostrophe (')</h2>
        <p>
            This punctuation is used to join two words together to make reading smooth.<br>
            Let's explore the functions of the apostrophe:<br>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    To form a possessive<br>
                    A possessive is a word used to show ownership of something. 
                    The apostrophe helps to form the possessive of a singular word (regardless of whether the word ends with an "s" or not) and an irregular plural noun (plural nouns that down end with the letter "s") by adding an "s". 
                    However, for regular plural nouns (plural nouns that end with an "s"), you do not add an "s". 
                    You must also know that possessive pronouns do not use an apostrophe to be formed.<br>
                    <u>Example:</u><br>
                    Chads car is luxurious. ✖<br>
                    Chad's car is luxurious. ✔<br>
                    The bussiness' policy is new. ✖<br>
                    The business's policy is new. ✔<br>
                    The children's books contain very few pages. ✔<br>
                    They are the boys's dogs. ✖<br>
                    They are the boys' dogs. ✔<br>
                    It's milk poured. ✖<br>
                    Its milk poured. ✔
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    To form contractions<br>
                    This is used on pronouns and singular nouns to make reading smooth.<br>
                    <u>Example:</u><br>
                    He is going to get an iPhone. ✔<br>
                    He's going to get an iPhone. ✔<br>
                    The child is playing. ✔<br>
                    The child's playing. ✔
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
