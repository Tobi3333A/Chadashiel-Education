        <h2>Reading & Writing</h2>
        <p>This section, which is divided into two (2) modules, includes short reading passages with one passage being for one question. 
        Each passage contains about 25 to 150 words to allow students have enough time to answer the questions. 
        Also, the passages usually cover areas like history, science, and literature. This section has four (4) domains: Information and Ideas, Craft and Structure, Expression of Ideas, and Standard English Conventions. 
        Questions of the same domain are usually put together for proper organization, and each module contains questions from all four domains.
        </p>
        <h4>Information and Ideas</h4>
        <p>This domain tests a student's ability to analyze passages (and graphs) and use inferences from those passages to answer questions. 
        It measures the level of a student's comprehension, reasoning & analysis skills, and ability to locate, interpret, and form ideas from texts and graphs. 
        This domain contains three (3) types of questions: Inferences, Command of Evidence, and Central Ideas and Details.
        </p>
        <h4>Craft and Structure</h4>
        <p>This domain tests a student's ability to use various words or phrases and the ability to understand the function of a group of words to a passage. 
        It measures the level of a student's vocabulary, comprehension, reasoning & analysis skills, and ability to utilize words in a passage and make connections between related passages. 
        This domain contains two (2) types of questions: Words in Context and Text Structure & Purpose.
        </p>
        <h4>Expression of Ideas</h4>
        <p>This domain tests a student's ability to write a passage that expresses relevant ideas effectively and improve the effectiveness of the expression of a passage. 
        It measures the level of a student's comprehension, reasoning & analysis skills, and ability to express thoughts. 
        This domain contains two (2) types of questions: Transitions and Rhetorical Synthesis.
        </p>
        <h4>Standard English Conventions</h4>
        <p>This domain tests a student's ability to write a passage that conforms to the standard conventions of English (this majorly entails being grammatically correct). 
        It measures a students level of understanding of punctuations and verb tenses. 
        This domain contains two (2) types of questions: Boundaries and Form, Structure & Sense.
        </p>
        <h2>Math</h2>
        <p>This section, which is also divided into two (2) modules, includes math questions with real-life applications, covering the areas of mat that have the largest influence on careers. 
        The questions in each module are usually arranged from the easiest to hardest to allow students perform in their best possible way. 
        This section contains four (4) areas: Algebra, Advanced Math, Problem-Solving & Data Analysis, and Geometry & Trigonometry. 
        Each module contains questions from all four areas just like the Reading & Writing Section.
        </p>
        <h4>Algebra</h4>
        <p>This area tests a student's ability to interpret graphs and solve both linear and quadratic equations. 
        It measures a student's level of reasoning and understanding of algebra. 
        This area contains five (5) types of questions: Linear Functions, Linear Equations in One Variable, Linear Equations in Two Variables, Linear Inequalities in One or Two Variables, and Systems of Two Linear Equations in Two Variables. 
        There are usually about <span class="highlight">13-15</span> questions from this area on the test.
        </p>
        <h4>Advanced Math</h4>
        <p>This area just like its name contains advanced level math. 
        It tests a student's ability to understand more difficult math concepts than normal ones. 
        It measures a student's level of reasoning and understanding of algebra and more math concepts. 
        This area contains three (3) types of questions: Nonlinear Functions, Equivalent Expressions, and Nonlinear Equations in One Variable & Systems of Equations in Two Variables. 
        There are usually <span class="highlight">13-15</span> questions from this area on the test.
        </p>
        <h4>Problem-Solving & Data Analysis</h4>
        <p>This area tests a student's ability to understand and analyze data whether it is presented in texts, graphs, ratios, or even percentages. 
        It measures a student's level of reasoning and understanding of data analysis. 
        This area contains six (6) types of questions: Percentages, One-variable data: Distributions and measures of center and spread, Two-variable data: Models and scatterplots, Probability and conditional probability, Ratios, rates, proportional relationships, and units, and Inference from sample statistics and margin of error. 
        There are usually <span class="highlight">5-7</span> questions from this area on the test.
        </p>
        <h4>Geometry & Trigonometry</h4>
        <p>This area tests a student's ability to understand how angles and lengths work in shapes (plane shapes or solid shapes). 
        It measures a student's level of reasoning and understanding of these math concepts (Geometry and Trigonometry). 
        This area contains three (3) types of questions: Area & Volume, Lines, angles, & triangles, and Right triangles & trigonometry. 
        There are also usually <span class="highlight">5-7</span>questions on from this area on the test.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The DSAT was created to prepare high school students well for college, but it was not made to be very hard. 
        With practice and hard work, you will see your practice scores go higher. 
        Check out College Board's DSAT Question Bank <a href="https://satsuitequestionbank.collegeboard.org/digital/search" target="_blank">here</a>. 
        Next, I will be giving tips on how to prepare well for the DSAT. Good success test-takers!
