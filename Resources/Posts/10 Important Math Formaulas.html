        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            On the DSAT Math Section, different question types are tested, some of which (if not all) need knowledge of some formulas to be solved correctly. Thankfully, College Board already gives us many formulas on the reference sheet that can be used during the test. However, there are some vital formulas not on the reference sheet. That is what we will be talking about on this post.<br>
            <u>We will be talking about:</u><br>
            <a href="#QF">Quadratic Formula</a>, <a href="#DS">Difference of Squares</a>, <a href="#FFQ">Factored Form of a Quadratic</a>, <a href="#CIF">Compound Interest Formula</a>, <a href="#SIF">Slope-Intercept Formula</a>, 
            <a href="#SFCE">Standard Form of a Circle Equation</a>, <a href="#AF">Average Formula</a>, <a href="#DF">Distance Formula</a>, <a href="#EGD">Exponential Growth or Decay</a>, and <a href="#SPF">Simple Probability Formula</a>.<br>
            Let's check out these formulas:
        </p>
        <h3 id="QF">Quadratic Formula</h3>
        <img src="../Images/Quadratic Formula.png" alt="Quadratic Formula" style="width: 300px; height: auto; display: block;">
        <p>
            <strong>Where:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>x = the variable representing the solutions</li>
                <li>a = the coefficient of x²</li>
                <li>b = the coefficient of x</li>
                <li>c = the constant term</li>
                <li>± indicates that there are generally two solutions: one for addition and one for subtraction</li>
            </ul>
            This formula is used to solve quadratic equations, which are equations whose highest power is 2.<br>
            They are in the form: <span class="lat">ax² + bx + c = 0</span>, where <span class="lat">a ≠ 0</span>.<br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>
            Find the values of x for which <span class="lat">2x² = 14x + 36</span><br>
            <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
            This <span class="highlight">must</span> be re-arranged to give <span class="lat">2x² - 14x - 36 = 0</span><br>
            Here, <span class="lat">a = 2;  b = -14;  c = -36</span>.	Take note that the signs (positive or negative) matter.<br>
            <div id="one">
                <div class="formula">
                    Using the formula, we'd have this.<br>
                    Solving this, we'd get <span class="lat">x = 3.5 ± 5.5</span><br>
                    That gives <span class="lat">x = 9</span> or <span class="lat">x = -2</span>
                </div>
                <div  class="imge">
                    <img src="../Images/QFSolution.png" style="width: 300px; height: auto;">
                </div>
            </div><br>
            An easier method might be breaking down the values.<br>
            In the equation above, you will notice that <span class="lat">a, b, c, 0</span> are multiples of 2, so we can factor 2 out to get <span class="lat">x² - 7x - 18 = 0</span>.<br>
            This way, we get to work with smaller values, which can make your work seem easier. Either way, you'll get the same answer.<br>
            To check your answers, you can substitute these values for <span class="lat">x</span> in the equation. 
            If the equation aligns, the values are correct; if it doesn't, there's something wrong with your work.
        </p>
        <h3 id="DS">Difference of Squares</h3>
        <span class="lat">a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)</span><br>
        <strong>Where:</strong><br>
        <span class="lat">a</span> and <span class="lat">b</span> are just algebraic expressions.<br>
        This is majorly used in algebra problems. It can really make problems simpler.<br>
        <u>Example:</u><br>
        Solve: 38² - 32² <br>
        <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
        This can be changed to: <span class="lat">(38 - 32)(38 + 32)</span><br>
        That way, you get: <span class="lat">(6)(70) = 420</span><br>
        Isn't that much easier than finding the individual squares and subtracting?
        <h3 id="FFQ">Factored Form of a Quadratic</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="lat">y = a(x - p)(x - q)</span><br>
            <strong>Where:</strong><br>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="lat">y</span> is the dependent variable.</li>
                <li><span class="lat">a</span> is a coefficient that affects the width and direction of the parabola.</li>
                <li><span class="lat">p</span> and <span class="lat">q</span> are the roots (or zeros) of the quadratic equation.</li>
            </ul>
            <u>Example:</u><br>
            Find the factored form of this quadratic equation: <span class="lat">f(x) = x² - 5x + 6</span><br>
            <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
            To find the roots, you can set the quadratic equation to zero:<br>
            <span class="lat">x² - 5x + 6 = 0</span><br>
            Using the quadratic formula, you can determine that the roots are:
            <span class="lat">x = 2</span> and <span class="lat">x = 3</span>.<br>
            Therefore, the factored form of the quadratic equation is:<br>
            <span class="lat">f(x) = a(x - 2)(x - 3)</span><br>
            That means:
            <span class="lat">x² - 5x + 6 = a(x - 2)(x - 3)</span><br>
            Hence
            <span class="lat">x² - 5x + 6 = a(x² - 5x + 6)</span><br>
            Thus
            <span class="lat">a = 1</span>, so the final factored form is:<br>
            <span class="lat">f(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)</span><br>
            You can always expand this form to check if it matches the original quadratic equation.
        </p>
        <h3 id="CIF">Compound Interest Formula</h3>
        <img src="../Images/Compound Interest Formula.png" alt="Compound Interest Formula" style="width: 300px; height: auto; display: block;">
        <p>
            <strong>Where:</strong><br>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="lat">A</span> = the total amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.</li>
                <li><span class="lat">P</span> = the principal amount (the initial amount of money).</li>
                <li><span class="lat">r</span> = the annual interest rate (decimal).</li>
                <li><span class="lat">n</span> = the number of times that interest is compounded per year.</li>
                <li><span class="lat">t</span> = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for.</li>
            </ul>
            This formula is used to calculate the total amount of money accumulated after a certain period, considering compound interest.<br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>
            If you invest $1000 at an annual interest rate of 5% compounded quarterly for 3 years, what will be the total amount?<br>
            <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
            Here, <span class="lat">P = 1000</span>, <span class="lat">r = 0.05</span>, <span class="lat">n = 4</span>, and <span class="lat">t = 3</span>.<br>
            Plugging these values into the formula:<br>
            <div id="two">
                <div class="formula">
                    A = 1000(1 + 0.05/4)^(4*3)<br>
                    A = 1000(1 + 0.0125)^(12)<br>
                    A ≈ 1000(1.1616) ≈ $1161.62
                </div>
                <div class="imge">
                    <img src="../Images/CIFSolution.png" style="width: 300px; height: 50px;">
                </div>
            </div><br>
            So, after 3 years, you would have approximately $1161.62.
        </p>
        <h3 id="SIF">Slope-Intercept Formula</h3>
        <p>
            The slope-intercept form of a linear equation is expressed as:<br>
            <span class="lat">y = mx + b</span><br>
            <strong>Where:</strong><br>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="lat">y</span> = the dependent variable (output).</li>
                <li><span class="lat">m</span> = the slope of the line (rise over run).</li>
                <li><span class="lat">x</span> = the independent variable (input).</li>
                <li><span class="lat">b</span> = the y-intercept (the value of y when x = 0).</li>
            </ul>
            This formula is used to express a linear equation in a way that makes it easy to identify the slope and y-intercept of the line.<br>
            You should note that coordinates are written as: (x, y)<br>
            <strong>Note:</strong> The y-intercept occurs when the value of the x-coordinate is 0; the x-intercept occurs when the value of the y-coordinate is 0.<br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>
            If a line has a slope of 2 and a y-intercept of -3, what is the equation of the line?<br>
            <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
            Using the slope-intercept form:<br>
            <span class="lat">y = 2x - 3</span><br>
            This means that for every unit increase in x, y increases by 2, and when x = 0, y = -3.
        </p>
        <h3 id="SFCE">Standard Form of a Circle Equation</h3>
        <p>
            The standard form of a circle's equation is expressed as:<br>
            <span class="lat">(x - h)² + (y - k)² = r²</span><br>
            <strong>Where:</strong><br>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="lat">h</span> = the x-coordinate of the center of the circle.</li>
                <li><span class="lat">k</span> = the y-coordinate of the center of the circle.</li>
                <li><span class="lat">r</span> = the radius of the circle.</li>
            </ul>
            This formula is used to represent a circle in a way that makes it easy to identify its center and radius.
            If you have a different form of the circle's equation, it can often be converted to this standard form by completing the square.<br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>
            If a circle has a center at (3, 4) and a radius of 5, what is the equation of the circle?<br>
            <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
            Using the standard form:<br>
            <span class="lat">(x - 3)² + (y - 4)² = 5²</span><br>
            Simplifying this gives:<br>
            <span class="lat">(x - 3)² + (y - 4)² = 25</span><br>
            This means that any point (x, y) that satisfies this equation lies on the circumference of the circle.
        </p>
        <h3 id="AF">Average Formula</h3>
        <img src="../Images/Average Formula.png" alt="Average Formula" style="width: 300px; height: auto; display: block;">
        <p>
            <strong>Where:</strong><br>
            <ul>
                <li>The sum of all values is the total obtained by adding all the numbers in the set.</li>
                <li>The number of values is the count of how many numbers are in the set.</li>
            </ul>
            This formula is used to find the central tendency of a set of numbers.<br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>
            Find the average of the numbers 4, 8, 12, and 16.<br>
            <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
            First, calculate the sum: 4 + 8 + 12 + 16 = 40<br>
            Then, count the number of values: There are 4 numbers.<br>
            Now, apply the formula:<br>
            Average = 40 / 4 = 10<br>
            So, the average of these numbers is 10.<br>
            It's that simple!
        </p>
        <h3 id="DF">Distance Formula</h3>
        <img src="../Images/Distance Formula.png" alt="Distance Formula" style="width: 300px; height: auto; display: block;">
        <p>
            <strong>Where:</strong><br>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="lat">d</span> = the distance between two points.</li>
                <li><span class="lat">(x₁, y₁)</span> = the coordinates of the first point.</li>
                <li><span class="lat">(x₂, y₂)</span> = the coordinates of the second point.</li>
            </ul>
            This formula is used to calculate the straight-line distance between two points in a Cartesian coordinate system.<br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>
            Find the distance between the points (3, 4) and (7, 1).<br>
            <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
            Using the formula:<br>
            d = √((7 - 3)² + (1 - 4)²)<br>
            d = √(4² + (-3)²)<br>
            d = √(16 + 9)<br>
            d = √25<br>
            d = 5<br>
            So, the distance between these two points is 5 units.
        </p>
        <h3 id="EGD">Exponential Growth or Decay</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="../Images/Exponential Formula.png" alt="Exponential Growth or Decay" style="width: 300px; height: auto; display: block;">
            <strong>Where:</strong><br>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="lat">A</span> = the quantity at time t.</li>
                <li><span class="lat">A₀</span> = the initial quantity (at time t = 0).</li>
                <li><span class="lat">r</span> = the growth (or decay) rate (as a decimal).</li>
                <li><span class="lat">n</span> = <span class="lat">time(t)/interval</span></li>
            </ul>
            This formula is used to model situations where a quantity grows or decays exponentially over time.<br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>
            If a population of bacteria doubles every 3 hours, and you start with 100 bacteria, how many will there be after 9 hours?<br>
            <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
            Here, <span class="lat">A₀ = 100</span>, <span class="lat">r = 1</span> (since it doubles), <span class="lat">interval = 3</span>, and <span class="lat">t = 9</span>.<br>
            The number of growth periods (<span class="lat">n</span>) in 9 hours is <span class="lat">9 / 3 = 3</span>.<br>
            Using the formula:<br>
            <div id="three">
                <div class="formula">
                    A = 100 * (2)^(9/3)<br>
                    A = 100 * (2)^3<br>
                    A = 100 * 8<br>
                    A = 800
                </div>
                <div class="imge">
                    <img src="../Images/EGDSolution.png" style="width: 300px; height: auto;">
                </div>
            </div><br>
            So, after 9 hours, there will be 800 bacteria.<br>
            This formula can also be used for decay by using a decay rate instead of a growth rate.
        </p>
        <h3 id="SPF">Simple Probability Formula</h3>
        <p>
        <img src="../Images/Probability Formula.png" alt="Simple Probability Formula" style="width: 300px; height: auto; display: block;">
            <strong>Where:</strong><br>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="lat">P(E)</span> = the probability of an event E occurring.</li>
            </ul>
            This formula is used to calculate the likelihood of a specific event occurring.<br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>
            If you roll a fair six-sided die, what is the probability of rolling a 4?<br>
            <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
            Here, there is 1 favorable outcome (rolling a 4) and 6 possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).<br>
            Using the formula:<br>
            P(E) = n(E) / n(S) = 1 / 6<br>
            So, the probability of rolling a 4 is approximately 0.1667 or 16.67%.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            I hope you were able to understand everything explained here. 
            You should know that the examples explained here are simple compared to what would be seen on the DSAT in most cases, but the examples are just to bring you into the topic. 
            I will create individual posts for each topic. Remember to keep on practicing. Good success test-takers!
