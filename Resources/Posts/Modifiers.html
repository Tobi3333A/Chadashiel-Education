        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Just one misplaced phrase in a sentence can make the whole sentence confusing and ambiguous. I think of modifiers as phrases that qualify or modify (provide detail) a part of a sentence. 
            For the DSAT, you should focus on subject-modifiers (they modify the subject of a sentence), but I'll explain all of them. For example, in the sentence, "Watching a movie, Chad forgot to turn of the cooker," "Watching a movie" is a modifier that qualifies "Chad (the subject of the sentence)." 
            The DSAT usually tests test-takers on this kind of questions, and in my opinion, they are very easy, so they should be free marks for students. This is why it's important to understand it.
        </p>
        <h3>What are Modifiers</h3>
        <p>
            Modifiers are words, phrases, or clauses that provide detail about a part of a sentence.<br>
            Let's go through the common types of modifiers:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <u><strong>Adjectives:</strong></u> These are words that qualify a noun or pronoun in a sentence.<br>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> Chadashiel has a great mind.<br>
                    In the example, "great" qualifies the noun "mind".
                </li>
                <li>
                    <u><strong>Adverbs:</strong></u> These are words that modify an adjective, verb, or another adverb in a sentence.<br>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> Chadashiel is extremely awesome.<br>
                    In the example, "extremely" modifies the adjective "awesome".
                </li>
                <li>
                    <u><strong>Phrases and Clauses:</strong></u> A phrase is a group of words that doesn't have both a subject and a verb (could have one or neither). 
                    A clause is a group of words that has both a subject and a verb; this doesn't mean all clauses can stand on their own...some are dependent (can't stand on their own), and some are independent (can stand on their own).<br>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> The cat in the compound is our neighbor's.<br>
                    In the example, "in the compound" is a phrase that provides more detail about the cat.<br>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> He skipped his meal because he was not hungry.<br>
                    In the example, "because he was not hungry" is a clause that provides more detail about "skipped," telling us why he skipped his meal.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Common Modifier Mistakes on the Digital SAT</h3>
        <p>
            There are different ways students could make mistakes when answering modifier questions on the Digital SAT, some little mistakes...some big.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <u><strong>Misplaced Modifiers:</strong></u> A misplaced modifier is far from the word it is modifying in a sentence.<br>
                    <strong>Example:</strong><br>
                    He almost forgot his keys everyday.  ✖<br>
                    The sentence in the example suggests that he almost forgot his keys (didn't actually forget them), but the writer is trying to suggest that he forgot them...just not everyday.<br>
                    He forgot his keys almost everyday.  ✔<br>
                    Now, this sentence suggests that he actually forgot his key sometimes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <u><strong>Dangling Modifiers:</strong></u> A dangling modifier is one that has nothing in a sentence that it logically attaches to.<br>
                    <strong id="pcil">Example:</strong><br>
                    Getting extremely late for school, his pencil was forgotten.  ✖<br>
                    This sentence suggests that his pencil was getting extremely late for school, which is obviously not the case.<br>
                    Getting extremely late for school, he forgot his pencil.  ✔<br>
                    Now, this suggests that he was getting extremely late for school, causing him to forget his pencil.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <u><strong>Unclear References:</strong></u> Here, it's confusing what noun or pronoun a modifier is referring to in a sentence.<br>
                    <strong>Example:</strong><br>
                    Sasha told Banks that she lost the title.  ✖<br>
                    In this sentence, it is unclear who lost the title. Sasha or Banks?<br>
                    Sasha told Banks, "I won the title."  ✔<br>
                    Now, it's clear that it was Sasha that won the title.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>How to Fix Modifier Errors</h3>
        <p>
            There are just three steps to be taken to fix modifier errors:
            <ul>
                <li>Identify the modifier</li>
                <li>Find out what it is meant to be describing</li>
                <li>Make sure they're next to each other</li>
            </ul>
            <u>Let's use this example:</u> He almost forgot his keys everyday.
            First, we identify the modifier: "almost."
            Next, we find out what it is meant to modify. "Almost" is trying to tell us how often he forgot his keys, so it's modifying "everyday."
            Finally, we're to make sure they're next to each other.
            <u>Corrected sentence:</u> He forgot his keys almost everyday.
            <strong>Note:</strong> The first sentence would be correct if the writer was trying to say that he didn't actually forget his keys. 
            For the sake of this example, I am saying that's not what the writer (I) suggests.
        </p>
        <h3>Quick Strategy for the SAT</h3>
        <p>
            You need to be able to spot modifier errors quickly for the SAT. Since you know how to correct them now, all you have to do is know when there is an error. The DSAT usually focuses on subject-modifiers, so let's focus on that.<br>
            To identify subject-modifiers, you just have to know what noun or pronoun in a sentence, a modifier could be describing.<br>
            In the example used <a href="#pcil">here</a>, we knew that it's a person that can be late (not a pencil), so we knew the first sentence was an error.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            Modifier questions on the Digital SAT are probably the simplest kind of questions you'll find on the test, so it's best to fully understand them; they'll be free marks, later on. 
            Don't forget to keep on practicing. Good success test-takers!
