        <h2>TRANSITIONS</h2>
        <p>
            These are words or group of words used to connect a sentence to the sentence before it. 
            They show how one sentence relates to the one before it. 
            The sentence could either contradict, support, or each other. 
            You must know that a transition is non-essential in a sentence, so it works with commas and can be used at the beginning, middle, or end of a sentence. 
            For more information about the use of commas with transitions or non-essential clauses as a whole, check here. 
            There are three types of transitions: <a href="#cont">Continuers</a>, <a href="#contr">Contradictors</a>, and <a href="#cae">Cause-and-Effect Transitions</a>.
        </p>
        <h4 id="cont">Continuers</h4>
        <p>
            These are transitions that indicate that two sentences are expressing similar ideas.<br>
            <u>Example of use:</u> Chad was very good at the tournament. In fact, he won it.<br>
            There are four (4) functions of continuers:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <u>To add information:</u> Here, transitions are used to show that a sentence is adding more information to the theme/topic of the previous sentence.<br>
                    Examples of such transitions: also, furthermore, in addition, and moreover.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <u>To give examples:</u> Here, transitions are used to make a sentence introduce an example or examples that support an idea talked about in the previous sentence.<br>
                    Examples of such transitions: for example and for instance.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <u>To clarify:</u> Here, transitions are used to show that a sentence sheds more light on the idea talked about in the previous sentence.<br>
                    Examples of such transitions: that is, essentially, in other words, and effectively.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <u>To emphasize:</u> Here, transitions are used to show the severity of the idea talked about in the previous sentence.<br>
                    Examples of such transitions: in fact and indeed.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h4 id="contr">Contradictors</h4>
        <p>
            These are transitions that indicate that two sentences are expressing opposite ideas.<br>
            <u>Examples of such transitions:</u> although, alternatively, but, conversely, despite, even so, even though, however, instead, rather, still, nevertheless, nonetheless, otherwise, whereas, meanwhile, and regardless.<br>
            <u>Example of use:</u> Tobi looks very weak. However, he is very strong.<br>
        </p>
        <h4 id="cae">Cause-and-Effect Transitions</h4>
        <p>
            These are transitions that indicate that the action performed in one sentence was a result of what happened in the previous sentence.<br>
            <u>Examples of such transitions:</u> accordingly, as such, as a result, for this reason, consequently, hence, thus, therefore, to this end.<br>
            <u>Example of use:</u> She fell. Because of that, she broke her arm.
        </p>
        <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p>
            Understanding how transitions are used is very vital for a successful test experience. 
            You need to note that transitions relate a sentence to the one <span class="highlight">BEFORE</span> it; it is important that you remember that. 
            To be completely good with transitions questions on the DSAT, you have to be able to interpret the text and understand its idea. 
            To be good at that, you must practice more. Good success test-takers!
