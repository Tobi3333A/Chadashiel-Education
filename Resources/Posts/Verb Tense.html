        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Verb tense questions on the Digital SAT (DSAT) test your ability to recognize the timing of actions and ensure consistency across sentences. 
            While these may seem simple, they can be tricky if you’re not watching for subtle time cues or unexpected shifts in tense. 
            This guide will help you master the key rules and identify common traps.
        </p>
        <h3>Why Verb Tense Is Important</h3>
        <p>
            Grammar questions on the DSAT aren’t about memorizing definitions—they’re about reading in context. Every verb must agree with the sentence’s timeline. 
            If you use the wrong tense, you could unintentionally confuse the meaning.
            <u><strong>Tip:</strong></u> Always read the entire sentence or paragraph before answering!
        </p>
        <h3>Keep Tenses Consistent</h3>
        <p>
            When a sentence talks about events happening in the same time period, your verbs should stay in that time frame.<br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>
            She wakes up and was eating breakfast. ✖<br>
            She woke up and ate breakfast. ✔<br>
            There’s no reason to shift from present to past tense—so stay consistent unless something in the sentence demands a shift.
        </p>
        <h3>Look for Time Clues</h3>
        <p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Time Clue</th>
                    <th>Verb Tense</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>now, today</td>
                    <td>Present Tense</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>yesterday, last week</td>
                    <td>Past Tense</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>by the time, before, after</td>
                    <td>Perfect Tense</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>will, going to, tomorrow</td>
                    <td>Future Tense</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>for years, since</td>
                    <td>Present/Past Perfect Tense</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <u>Example:</u><br>
            She had eaten before the guests arrived.  ✔<br>
            The word "before" suggests one action happened earlier in the past.
        </p>
        <h3>Understand The Perfect Tenses</h3>
        <p>
            Perfect tenses are used to show the relationship between two time points—either past-to-past, past-to-now, or future-to-future.
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Tense</th>
                    <th>When to Use</th>
                    <th>Example</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Present Perfect</td>
                    <td>Action started in the past and continues</td>
                    <td>I have lived here for 5 years.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Past Perfect</td>
                    <td>One action happened before another in past</td>
                    <td>She had left when I arrived.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Future Perfect</td>
                    <td>Action will be completed before future time</td>
                    <td>They will have finished by noon.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </p>
        <h3>Be Careful With Tense Shifts</h3>
        <p>
            You should only change tense if the timeline changes.<br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>
            He was walking to class and finds a note. ✖<br>
            He was walking to class and found a note. ✔<br>
            The first verb is in past progressive ("was walking")—so the second action should also stay in the past.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            Keep tenses consistent unless a clear shift is needed.<br>
            Look for time clues like “before,” “since,” and “by the time”.<br>
            Learn the differences between past, present, and perfect tenses.<br>
            Read the entire sentence before choosing an answer.<br>
