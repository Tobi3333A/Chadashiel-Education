        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>
            Many students feel a lot of pressure to do well on the SAT. It's normal. 
            The SAT is practically a college entrance exam, and a lot of you planning to get into top colleges believe you have to get high scores (of course with high GPA's and good EC's). 
            That's true, and I know you put in a lot of effort into preparing for the SAT, so you feel this pressure from your yourself and probably friends that expect you to score high, but the fact that you put in a lot of effort is the reason you should be calm on test day. 
            You've studied hard. What more can you do? Believe in yourself. That's the only thing you can do.<br>
            You should know that being calm and mentally prepared on test day is just as important as all the academic prep you've done for the test. 
            Losing focus during the test can disrupt your thinking (stuff you can normally solve start to seem strange all of a sudden), make you forget even the easiest things, and make miss important details when reading your questions. 
            If all these happen to you on test day, all of your academic prep will get wasted. I know you don't want that to happen, and I also don't want that to happen to you.<br>
            Let's go through these tips on how to stay calm and focused on test day:
        </p>
        <h2>Understand the Root of Test Anxiety</h2>
        <p>
            I will just be emphasizing on some stuff I already talked about in the introduction.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <u>Why anxiety happens:</u> You prepared a lot: studied for long hours, attended all classes possible, did all the practice tests, and watched YouTube videos. 
                    Because of this, you tend to feel pressure from yourself that you must score high on the test. Friends and family who have high expectations of you might also be a source of pressure. 
                    Maybe you need to get a scholarship to be able to attend a good college (rather than a community college). Maybe you've always dreamed of going to Stanford since 7th grade. 
                    These are also sources of pressure you might feel on test day. You start to overthink, and the pressure just keeps on building up on your inside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <u>How it affects performance:</u> All this pressure <strong>will</strong> affect your test performance. Your attention becomes divided: while solving a question, you're also thinking of how good/bad you're gonna do on the test. 
                    With your attention divided, you start to miss important details when reading questions; you could even have spent minutes trying to solve a question (remember the average time to solve a question is just a little above 1 minute) before you realize you missed an important detail that made the question seem impossible to solve. 
                    Because you've spent too much time on a question (probably a question you were supposed to spend seconds on), you start to rush other questions. 
                    With pressure on your mind, your thinking becomes foggy, and you could even blank out. Do you see how much problems overthinking could cause for you on test day. 
                    All the prep you've done could go wasted if this happens. This is why it is <strong>very important</strong> to be calm and focused.

            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Pre-Test Preparation: Calm Begins Before Test Day</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Get 8+ hours of sleep. Do your best to sleep well the night before test day, so your mind can be refreshed. 
                    This way, ideas and nice thoughts would easily appear during your test: you'll be able to think very well.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Eat a balanced breakfast. You should know that food helps the brain. Much better, a balanced food set is vital for an excellent brain activity. 
                    It's your brain you're gonna use to think during your test! So, feed it properly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pack materials and ID the night before test day. You don't want to forget to take anything important to your test center. 
                    It's better to pack everything you'll need the night before and check again before you leave your homes on test day. 
                    You could be rushing on test day, and trust me, you don't want to forget some things. I've known someone who couldn't write the test because he forgot his passport. You don't want that to be you!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Visualize a smooth test-day experience. I won't lie to you...I don't really know how this works, but I think it's good. It might work for you. 
                    In fact, it might be what you need, so just try it. 
                    Imagine yourself doing the test under all the test conditions (time, pressure, anxiety...), and try to prepare your mind for those conditions.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Focus-Boosting Habits</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Don't rush your test. Don't be slow, either. I think the word is "steady." Yes. Be steady. If you rush, you won't know when start to miss details in questions (some details the questions can't be solved without). 
                    Of course, at first, you won't know you missed a detail, so you might be wondering how College Board expects you to solve the question. 
                    Then, you start to spend lots of time before you decide to re-read the question. Then, you realize that you missed something. But, time has already gone. 
                    You become scared that you won't be able to finish the test. The pressure increases. You start to lose focus increasingly.<br>
                    <strong>Tip:</strong> If you ever think that the details you have are not sufficient to answer a question, re-read the question to ensure you're not missing anything.</li>
                <li>
                    Glance away from the screen sometimes. If you feel like the pressure is building up and you continue solving questions, take your eyes off your device and take a deep breath. 
                    Try to recuperate (I think my use of this word is right) yourself and remind yourself that you prepared for the test.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Renew your mind during the 10-minute break. During the 10-minute break, stretch yourself and renew your mind. If Reading & Writing didn't go as well as you wanted it to, you should know that means you should do more than your best during the Math; it doesn't mean you should give up or back down. 
                    It's better to fall than it is to have never risen (Gosh, I made this on the spot...I hope it makes sense to you).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Reframe Mistakes and Tough Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Don't panic. The last thing you want to do is panic. Like I have said, you have to be calm. f you come across a specifically complex question, skip it. Do not spend too much time on one question; you'll lose time for other easier questions. 
                Then, you'll start to rush, and more problems would begin. You can find more about how to manage time wisely <a href="./DSAT Time Management.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Avoid spiraling. Don't let the presence of one difficult question determine your whole test score. You have to prepare your mind. You might not find all questions to be easy, so prepare yourself for that. 
                Don't go on forcing yourself to solve one question that's very difficult when there are easier ones you haven't solved.<br>
                The only time you should keep on solving a difficult question is when you've solved and double-checked all the questions you can solve.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Practice Staying Calm Before the Test Day</h2>
        <p>
            Try to do some full practice tests on the Bluebook App under the test day conditions: simulate your test day experience. This way, you'll start preparing your mind to remove the pressure and overthinking. 
            If it works for you, you could try breathing techniques to calm yourself down. You should do at least four (4) practice tests on the Bluebook App under test day conditions (no breaks apart from the 10-minute break, no pausing...)
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The DSAT is a serious exam, but once you've prepared well, there isn't much you can do anymore. Don't be hard on yourself. Prepare to your best ability and do your best on test day. 
            Don't let your anxiety be the reason you don't do well on the test after weeks or months of prep. Be calm during your test and don't rush (don't be slow either). Do practice tests under test day conditions. You can do it y'all. Good success!
