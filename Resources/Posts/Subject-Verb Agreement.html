        <h2>SUBJECT-VERB AGREEMENT</h2>
        <p>
            In sentences, the subject and verb have to be in agreement, meaning that they have to have the same tense. 
            In subject-verb agreement questions on the DSAT, you basically just have to find out whether the subject of the sentence is singular or plural and then placing it with the right verb, but College Board tries to make it more complex than it is. 
            A subject is the noun or noun phrase in a sentence that performs the action (the verb) spoken about in the sentence.<br><br>
            Let's go through the steps to answer these type of questions.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Identify the subject:</strong> In subject-verb agreement questions, College Board tries to put non-essential clauses in the texts to distract test-takers from identifying the actual subject of the sentences in the text, so test-takers have to be very cautious.<br>
                    <u>Example:</u><br>
                    The works of Chad have been included in the list of the greatest works done on earth. ✖<br>
                    The works of Chad have been included in the list of the greatest works done on earth. ✔<br>
                    In the example above, the subject is "the <strong>works</strong> of Chad" because it is the works of Chad that were included in the list. 
                    Because the subject is plural (<u>works</u> of Chad), he verb must also be plural. In the first sentence, the verb used was "has", which is singular, so that is wrong.<br>
                    However, in the second sentence, the verb used was "have", which is plural, so that is right.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Identify the verb that agrees with the subject:</strong> After identifying whether the subject is singular or plural, you are to pick the right verb.<br>
                    Note: A singular subject goes with a singular verb, and a plural subject goes with a plural verb.<br>
                    A singular verb contains an "s". E.g plays<br>
                    A plural verb does not contain an "s". E.g play<br>
                    <u>Example:</u><br>
                    The child plays. ✔<br>
                    The child play. ✖<br>
                    The children play. ✔<br><br>
                    Note: Gerunds and collective nouns take singular verbs.<br>
                    <u>Example:</u><br>
                    Talking disrespectfully to your elders are bad. ✖<br>
                    Talking disrespectfully to your elders is bad. ✔<br>
                    The jury were sworn in. ✖<br>
                    The jury was sworn in. ✔<br><br>
                    Note: "That", "what", or "whether", when used as a subject use a singular verb<br>
                    <u>Example:</u><br>
                    That Chad teaches people are a good thing. ✖<br>
                    That Chad teaches people s a good thing. ✔

            </table><br>
            <strong>Note:</strong> When neither and nor or either and or are paired with two nouns, the verb will take the tense of the noun directly before it.<br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>
            Neither the boys nor Jessica have eaten. ✖<br>
            Neither Chad nor the girls have eaten. ✔<br><br>
            <strong>Note:</strong> When "some", "most", "more", and "all" are paired with a singular pronoun, they use singular verbs. But when they are paired with a plural pronoun, they use plural verbs.<br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>
            Most of it was civilized. ✔<br>
            Most of them are doctors. ✔

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Subject-verb agreements are one of the easiest parts of the Digital SAT, but College Board tries to make it seem more difficult. 
            It is not. You just need to practice a lot and get familiar with the way the questions are.
