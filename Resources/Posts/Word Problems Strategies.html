        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            A lot of students find word problems really hard to solve because they aren't always direct, sometimes. I mean who doesn't prefer "Solve <span class="lat">3 x 2</span>" to "How many was can the letters in 'SHY' be arranged?" 
            They still give the same answer (technically the same <span class="lat">3 x 2</span>), however: <span class="lat">6</span>. The problem is that sometimes, students get distracted by irrelevant details, or maybe they think too highly of the question, so even simple questions seem so difficult. 
            For these reasons, students find word problems time-consuming and frustrating. 
            Don't worry. I'm gonna tell you the basic steps to follow when solving word problems, so they don't look so confusing. Hence, you solve them faster and get higher scores.
        </p>
        <h2>Step 1: Understand the Problem</h2>
        <p>
            You must not rush word problems but don't be slow either. Take just as much time as is good. It is better to take your time to solve questions and get them right than to rush them and make mistakes.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <u>Look for what is being asked.</u> That way, you'll get an idea of what you have to do. Be calm and take your time to understand the concept of the question. 
                    This is the first step because it's after you're able to know what you're being asked that you'll know what details to look for in the question. 
                    This way, you'll know what details are irrelevant and those that are important.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <u>Underline (take note of) keywords.</u> After you know what a word problem wants you to do, take note of the important words that show they'll be needed to answer the word problem. 
                    Words like "<strong>total</strong>," "<strong>difference</strong>," and "<strong>per</strong>" are keywords in most questions that you mustn't miss. Also, take note of dimensional units: very important.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <u>Visualize them.</u> This will be very helpful for geometry and trigonometry questions. If the diagrams are not already included in the question, it will be really helpful if you draw them. 
                    This way, you'll be able to look at what you're solving. 
                    I feel this will have a way of helping you solve better and letting you see what theorems or rules you should apply more clearly because it can get all scrambled up in your head if you try to do it in your head.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Step 2: Translate Words into Math</h2>
        <p>
            Convert the question into equations or expressions. Now, you understand what the word problem asks for, and you know the essential stuff to take note of. 
            You already know wat to do. Yay! Now, you'll have to start solving.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Use variables for unknowns. On the Digital SAT (if not math in general), unknowns should be treated as variables (represented by a letter) because your job is usually to find that unknown, and this makes it much easier (if it's not even the only way).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Recognize structures. You should be able to identify the mathematical setup a word problem is trying to lead you to.<br>
                    <u>Example:</u> "Creed has two less apples than Chad."<br>
                    Representing that mathematically, if Chad has "<span class="lat">x</span>" apples, Creed will have "<span class="lat">x - 2</span>" apples. You must be able to identify stuff like this.<br>
                    <u>Another example:</u> "If Chad travelled 20 miles more than Creed, what percentage of Chad's distance did Creed cover if they started from the same point and went on the same path?" This one's more complex than the first one.<br>
                    If Creed travelled "<span class="lat">y miles</span>," Chad travelled "<span class="lat">y + 20 miles</span>."<br>
                    What percentage? This will be Creed's distance divided by Chad's distance, then multiplied by <span class="lat">100: [y/(y + 20)]100%</span>. If the question asked for what percentage of Creed's distance Chad covered, it would be Chad's distance divided by Creed's distance, then multiplied by <span class="lat">100</span> instead: <span class="lat">[(y + 20)/y]100%</span>. <br>
                    You need to be able to identify stuff like this, and the only way to do that is be practicing more questions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remember to ignore irrelevant information.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Step 3: Solve and Check</h2>
        <p>
            Now, you have everything! You've gotten this far, so everything is basically settled already. Just a few more steps remaining.<br>
            Solve carefully. You have your equation now, so just ensure to solve it carefully. Don't rush it. Don't do calculations is your head. Use your DESMOS calculator. This way, you'll eliminate all mistakes. You've gotten this far. I'm sure you don't want a little addition error to make you get a question wrong. Remember this is an objective and subjective test, so only your final answers matter.<br>
            Put the answer back into the question and check. You've gotten your answer now. You have to check if your answer fits into the question and if you actually did what the question asked you to do.<br>
            <u>Example:</u> "Creed has two less apples than Chad and they have a total of 6 apples. Find the number of apples Creed has."<br>
            Representing that mathematically, if Chad has "<span class="lat">x</span>" apples, Creed will have "<span class="lat">x - 2</span>" apples.<br>
            Thus, <span class="lat">x + (x - 2) = 6</span>.		Meaning, <span class="lat">2x - 2 = 6</span>		Hence, <span class="lat">2x = 8</span><br>
            Finally, <span class="lat">x = 4</span> and <span class="lat">x - 2 = 2</span>.<br>
            This means Chad has 4 apples and Creed has 2 apples. Summing that up, you get 6 apples. This means "<span class="lat">x</span>" is actually 4.<br>
            A mistake a student could make is putting in "4" as the answer because <span class="lat">x = 4</span>. However, the question asked for the number of apples Creed has, which is <span class="lat">x - 2</span>.<br>
            So, the actual answer is "2."		Yay!
        </p>
        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <p>
            Practice a lot of questions of different types.<br>
            Memorize important math formulas.<br>
            Manage your time wisely.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Word problems are not so difficult. You just have to understand the problem, translate it to math, then solve and check your answer. <span class="highlight">BUT</span> to even understand the problem in the first place, you have to be familiar with mathematical concepts. That's why practice is essential. 
            Ensure to practice kids. Good success! (I didn't add "test-takers this time).
