        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Parallelism is a grammatical structure that involves using the same pattern of words to show that two or more ideas have the same level of importance. 
            It is often used in lists, comparisons, and contrasts. For example, in the sentence "I like swimming, running, and biking," the parallel structure is created by using the gerund form of each verb.
            Understanding parallelism is crucial for the Digital SAT as it helps in constructing clear and concise sentences, which can significantly impact your score.
