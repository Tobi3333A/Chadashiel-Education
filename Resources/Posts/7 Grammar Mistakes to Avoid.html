        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Grammar mistakes can cost you easy points on the DSAT—even if you're a strong writer. The Reading & Writing section of the DSAT tests Grammar on.<br>
        Here are <span class="highlight">7</span> common grammar mistakes you should recognize and avoid:</p>
        <h3>Mistake #1: Subject-Verb Agreement Errors</h3>
        <p>
            Subject-Verb Agreement is a situation in which the subject used in a sentence matches the right verb. It is compulsory for a sentence to be grammatically correct. 
            The DSAT tests students on this, but makes it look harder than it actually is.
            Because of this, students often mismatch singular subjects with plural verbs or vice versa.<br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>
            The list of topics are wrong. ✖<br>
            The list of topics of topics is wrong. ✔<br>
            <u><strong>Tip:</strong></u> Identify the subject first. Remember that the subject is the part of the sentence performing the action (verb). 
            In the example above, the subject is "The <strong>list</strong> of topics. "list" is the essential word there, not "topics." It is one list of topics that is wrong, not the topics. 
            If it were topics, it would be: The topics were wrong. In short, you can just ignore prepositional phrases; in this case, the prepositional phrase is "of topics." So, you'll just read the sentence as "The list is wrong." 
            That way, you'll never make that mistake again.
        </p>
        <h3>Mistake #2: Misplaced Modifiers</h3>
        <p>
            Misplaced Modifiers are descriptive words, phrases, or clauses that are placed too far from the word they are meant to describe., which can make the sentence confusing.<br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>
            Walking through the hallway, the lockers we heard were noisy. ✖<br>
            Walking through the hallway, we heard the noisy lockers. ✔<br>
            <u><strong>Tip:</strong></u> Always place modifiers next to the word they describe. This way, the sentence will be grammatically correct and clearer to readers.
        </p>
        <h3>Mistake #3: Pronoun-Antecedent Disagreement</h3>
        <p>
            An antecedent is the noun that comes before a pronoun and tells you who or what the pronoun is talking about. Many students always place the wrong pronoun with the antecedent.<br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>
            Each student must bring their pencil. ✖<br>
            Each student must bring his or her pencil. ✔<br>
            <u><strong>Tip:</strong></u> The pronoun must agree in number and clarity with its noun. In the example above, the noun is "each student", and that is singular, so the pronoun after must also be singular. 
            That is why the use of "their" is wrong.
        </p>
        <h3>Mistake #4: Incorrect Use of Commas</h3>
        <p>
            Students either use too many commas or leave out necessary ones (especially in compound sentences or clauses).<br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>
            I went to the shop and I saw Jessica. ✖<br>
            I went to the shop, and I saw Jessica. ✔<br>
            <u><strong>Tip:</strong></u> Two independent clauses are separated by a comma and a Coordinating (FANBOYS) Conjunction. Remember that independent clauses are clauses that make complete sense on their own; hence, they can stand on their own. 
            For more information about how to use a comma, check this blog post.
        </p>
        <h3>Mistake #5: Faulty Parallelism</h3>
        <p>
            Parallelism is a grammatical device in which parts of a sentence follow the same grammatical structure. Sometimes, it is hard to know when a sentence lacks parallelism, and that is what the DSAT tests students on. However, there is just one trick for this.<br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>
            The teacher said he was a great student, always on time, and that he submitted his homework regularly. ✖<br>
            The teacher said he was a great student, was always on time, and was regular with his homework submissions. ✔<br>
            <u><strong>Tip:</strong></u> Items in a list or comparison must follow the same grammatical structure. In the example above, the correct sentence used parallelism; in this case, it was the use of the word, "was" before the item in the list (a great student, always on time, regular homework submissions).
        </p>
        <h3>Mistake #6: Run-on Sentences & Comma Splices</h3>
        <p>
            This error occurs when two independent clauses (complete thoughts) are joined incorrectly without the use of a punctuation or with the use of a comma.<br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>
            He finished the test he left the room. ✖<br>
            He finished the test, he left the room. ✖<br>
            He finished the test, and he left the room. ✔<br>
            He finished the test. He left the room. ✔<br>
            He finished the test; he left the room. ✔<br>
            <u><strong>Tip:</strong></u> For this, you should just know that two independent clauses are separated either by a comma and Coordinating Conjunction, a semicolon, or a period. Whichever one you decide to use depends on what you think would be better for a good flow or style for your sentence.
        </p>
        <h3>Mistake #7: Confusing Homophones or Word Choice Errors</h3>
        <p>
            Homophones are words that sound the same when spoken but have different meanings — and usually different spellings. Many students usually make mistakes because they mistake one word for another that sounds just like it.<br>
            <u>Example:</u><br>
            Its a great day for a ride. ✖<br>
            It's a great day for a ride. ✔<br>
            <u><strong>Tip:</strong></u> Try to always notice the spelling of each word and understand the context of the sentence n which it is used. This way, you will be able to know the right homophone to use.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            The DSAT usually tricks students to making these <span class="highlight">7</span> common errors, but they can easily be avoided. 
            If you can understand everything on this blog post, and you practice more, it will become almost impossible for you to make those errors.
