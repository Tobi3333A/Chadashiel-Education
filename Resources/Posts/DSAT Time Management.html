        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>
            The DSAT (Digital SAT) was made to test students' understanding of various concepts more than their speed in answering questions. 
            However, for a lot of students, especially those who are not extremely excellent in Math or English (particularly the reading section), the time allocated for the exam might still seem to not be enough.<br>
            Time management is very essential because it won't be nice if you have to rush answering some questions you actually know how to solve because you couldn't use the time wisely. 
            With excellent time management, you'll be able to answer questions you know properly and maybe even get some you don't know how to solve right.<br>
            Also, you should know that the DSAT uses adaptive testing (to find more about this, check here), and this might feel a little bit unfair for some of you, but it's actually fair. 
            Students that do well on the first module of a section (Reading & Writing or Math) get a harder second module for that section. 
            However, those who don't do well on the first module get an easier second module, but can only get a maximum of about 680 on that section. 
            For those, wo get the harder second module, you will have to be able to change speed because both modules will have the same time allocated, but one is now harder (sometimes, much harder).
        </p>
        <h2>Understanding the Timing and Structure</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <u>Reading & Writing Section:</u>Each module has <span class="highlight">27</span> questions and takes <span class="highlight">32</span> minutes to complete. 
                    This means you have approximately 1 minute and 12 seconds to answer each question.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <u>Math Section:</u>Each module has <span class="highlight">22</span> questions and takes <span class="highlight">35</span> minutes to complete. 
                    This means you have approximately 1 minute and 36 seconds to answer each question.
                </li>
            </ul>
            You should, however, know that some questions will be much harder than some others, so you will have to be able to answer some questions in less than a minute. 
            For me, the Grammar questions and the first few questions on each Math module were the ones I spent less than a minute on. 
            You should know that the Math questions are arranged from easy to hard.
        </p>
        <h2>Learn to Pace Yourself</h2>
        <p>
            You need to know how you will choose to answer questions on test day (the questions you'll spend less than a minute on and the other ones), and the only way you can do that is by practicing a lot. 
            This way, you'll know the questions that are easier (take less time) for you and those that are harder (take more time). 
            You'll also be able to know how much time you should spend on some types of questions. 
            This way, you'll be creating a personal time strategy. Above all, you'll be able to get familiar with DSAT style questions. 
            In short, you'll be able to know how your mind is best suited to answering the DSAT questions properly.<br>
            You should know that the best platform to practice for the DSAT if you want to have real test experience, which is what you need, is the Bluebook Test App. 
            This is the app you'll use to take your actual exam, and it has practice questions for you. 
            When you use the app for practice, you should do your best to do a practice test at once, rather than taking breaks, because that's the way you'll be able to simulate the actual test experience.
        </p>
        <h2>Know Which Questions to Skip or Flag</h2>
        <p>
            You should also know not to dwell too much on one question. 
            You have an average of 1 minute and some seconds to answer each question, so time is really valuable.<br>
            <u>My advice:</u><br>
            <span class="highlight">Flag</span> questions you are not sure of. There will be some questions that seem like you can solve, but you're just not sure. 
            Attempt them, pick the answer you think is best at that time, and flag the question. 
            When you are done with the questions you know how to solve absolutely well and have double-checked them, come back to these ones.<br>
            <span class="highlight">Skip</span> questions that are hard. Some reading questions or some of the last few math questions might be so difficult you have no idea what to do, so skip them. 
            Don't waste your test time on questions you don't know how to solve because no matter how much time you spend, you might not end up solving those questions correctly. 
            When you are done with the questions you know how to solve and have double-checked them, you can come back to these questions (you have nothing to lose). 
            Maybe the problem was that you were not thinking of something you should've thought of the first time you attempted the question. This time, you might think of it.<br>
            Finally, make sure not to leave any question unanswered. If you're absolutely lost on a question and time is running out, just guess. Who knows? You might be right.
        </p>
        <h2>Practice Mental Endurance</h2>
        <p>
            You need to prepare yourself mentally for the actual exam. This is another reason you need to use the Bluebook App to take practice tests without taking breaks (except the 10 minute break given). 
            The total time for the DSAT is <span class="highlight">2 hours 24 minutes</span> (including the break), so you have to be prepared to keep your mind very active for that amount of time. 
            You should know that the last section of the test is the second module of the Math, which can be harder one for some of you, and you should know that the last few questions of that module will be difficult, so your mind has to be ready!<br>
            In short, take full practice tests regularly. Let your mind be prepared for the conditions you will face on test day. It's the best way...probably, even the only way!
        </p>
        <h2>Use the Built-In Tools Wisely</h2>
        <p>
            The College Board became very generous with this new SAT format. There are many tools provided on the Bluebook App to make your test experience much better.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The <span class="highlight">DESMOS</span> calculator is your best friend. You can use this calculator to draw graphs and a lot of other things. You don't even have to solve some questions: just put them into the calculator. 
                    With this calculator, you can solve some questions that take about 1.5 minutes to solve manually in about 25 seconds (there may be some exaggeration here...I didn't use the calculator because I didn't need it...but it's very good). 
                    You must know how to use this calculator whether you think you need it or not. 
                    Maybe if I used the calculator, I'd have had more time to double-check questions when I got a 790 on the Math. There are many tutorials on how to use the calculator online.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There are also tools for highlighting and annotating. If you're comfortable with them, you can use them. It's not compulsory to use them. In fact, they can make some people slower on the test.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finally, there is a tool for cancelling out options. This tool will be very important on the Reading & Writing section to help you eliminate answer choices, so you can just pick the last answer choice. 
                    However, you also don't need to use this. 
                    You can just know the answer choices you're cancelling out in your head.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Knowing how to solve questions isn't enough to do well on the DSAT. You need to know how to solve them in <span class="highlight">time</span>. You can only learn this by practicing more questions on the Bluebook App under real test-taking conditions, regularly. Good success test-takers!
