        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>The SAT has <span class="highlight">changed</span>. This time, it's gone digital.
        Well, this has happened since March 2023 for international students and March 2024 for students in The United States.
        The Digital SAT (DSAT) has the same uses as the Paper SAT that was changed; it's just an upgrade College Board made to make testing much easier contemporary.
        </p>
        <h2>What is the DSAT?</h2>
        <P>The DSAT is a widely used standardized testing used for admission into undergraduate studies in the United States.
        It tests the skills you've gained in high school on reading, writing, and math to help colleges know how prepared you are for college course-work.
        I know you may be wondering why it tests on just reading, writing, and math.
        The answer is that the DSAT was not designed to test students on specific courses but to test how students can reason when presented with problems; 
        that's why you'll notice that a lot of the reading and math questions involve analyzing the text or graph presented to you.
        </p>
        <h2>Why the Change?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Faster Score Reporting:</strong> The results of the DSAT are usually released two weeks from the exam day. 
            This reduces anxiety in students and helps them make their decisions (on whether to take the exam again or start their college search) faster.</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Test Security:</strong> With the DSAT, the exam questions are more secured. How? 
            The DSAT is adaptive, so a student's second module for each subject is based on the student's performance on first module (students don't all get the same questions). 
            Also, the Bluebook app used to take the exam does not allow any other application to be open while the exam is ongoing.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What is the DSAT Used for?</h2>
        <p>The DSAT is mainly used for the the undergraduate admissions process in the United Students. 
        It helps colleges understand how ready a student is for college and to compare students from different places. 
        A high SAT score can strengthen a student's college application in most cases. 
        You should also know that some institutions use SAT Scores (usually with high school GPA) to award merit-based scholarships: this makes high performance on the exam very important. 
        You may be saying that schools have gone test-optional; however, schools went test-optional because of the COVID-19 Pandemic and have now started requiring test-scores again.
        </p>
        <h2>Who Can Take the DSAT?</h2>
        <p>The DSAT isn't restricted to any particular set of people: the DSAT can be taken by people (not just students) from all nationalities, sex, age, and race. 
        However, most people take the DSAT in their final years of high school. 
        Also, there is no limit to the number of times a person can take the DSAT. 
        However, most students usually take the exam twice as they aim for an improvement from their first time or to super-score their scores.
        </p>
        <h2>Key Differences from the Paper SAT</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Digital Format:</strong> The DSAT is taken on a tablet or a computer (not with a paper and pencil) on the Bluebook app made by College Board. 
            The devices used must have certain device requirements, so they can function properly with the Bluebook app; the requirements will be sent to everyone who applies to take the test.</li>
            <li><strong>Shorter Test Duration:</strong> The DSAT is a shorter test that takes 2 hours 14 minutes to complete compared to the the Paper SAT that was 3-hours long. 
            The shorter test duration does not make the test more difficult because the number of questions were also reduced. 
            In fact, College Board said the exam was designed to understand students' understanding of the concepts being tested and not their speed.</li>
            <li><strong>Adaptive:</strong> Unlike the Paper SAT where all students get questions of the same difficulty-level, the DSAT makes the difficulty-level of the questions in the second module of each subject depend on the performance of a student on the first module. 
            This helps to reduce the stress on a student. However, this does not mean a student should try to get low marks on the first module. 
            In fact, students should do their best on the first module because the highest score students who get to do the easier second module can get on a subject is in the mid 600s.</li>
            <li><strong>Calculator:</strong> The DSAT allows calculators to be used on both modules of the math exam as opposed to the Paper SAT that allowed use of calculator on only the second module. 
            Also, Bluebook has an in-built calculator called "<span class="highlight">DESMOS</span>" that has a lot of abilities. 
            It is advisable that a student knows how to use the DESMOS calculator as it could make the DSAT math extremely easy.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Structure and Timing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reading & Writing:</strong> This is the first section of the DSAT Exam. It has two modules that are 32 minutes each. 
            It contains passages (shorter ones compared to the Paper SAT) with one passage per question. 
            The passage covers a variety of topics like history and fashion. Some questions also include graphs that have to be interpreted. 
            This section tests vocabulary in context, evidence, grammar, and purpose.</li>
            <li><strong>Break:</strong> After the Reading & Writing section, there is a 10-minute break to allow students clear their minds, stretch their bodies, and prepare their minds for the math section.</li>
            <li><strong>Math</strong> This is the second section of the DSAT Exam. It has two modules that are 35 minutes each. 
            It covers topics like Algebra, Trigonometry, Data Analysis, Problem-solving, and Geometry. 
            This section mainly test your understanding of various math concepts by asking questions that involve real-life applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Scoring</h2>
        <p>The DSAT is scored just like the Paper SAT. The only difference is that the scoring for students who take the easier second module would be lower than that for those who take the harder second module. 
        Also, students are allowed to super-score just like it was in the Paper SAT. 
        The Total Score Range: 400-1600___Reading & Writing (200-800) and Math (200-800).
        </p>
        <h2>Accommodations</h2>
        <p>
        College Board did not neglect students with disabilities. The DSAT offers accommodations (extended time, larger font sizes, test-to-speech, extra breaks, and assistive technology like braille-compatible technology). 
        However, students must apply for accommodations via the College Board's SSD (Services for Students with Disabilities).
        </p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>This new SAT testing format has many benefits, including a much better testing system, quicker results, and higher test security. 
        Overall, this new format has made the test-taking experience much better. 
        However, students still need to play their parts in preparing well for the exam by being regular to classes, taking practice questions, and asking important questions.
