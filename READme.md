# Chadashiel Education
This is the website for my startup. It is still being worked on. My goal is to provide free education to SAT students. Later, I hope I can provide free coding tutoring also.
## Features
- **General Overview:** The website shows my goals and tells a little bit about my education journey. I did that to encourage people and show them they can trust me to give my best.
- **Blog-style Educational Posts & Exercises:** The website also includes tutorials in form of blogs to teach students various topics in the SAT. It also inlcudes tests to allow students evaluate their understaning of the blog posts.
- **Connection & Personal Tutoring:** The website includes a subscription form that students can use to connect with me and receive periodic updates and advice. Additionally, it allows them to see my schedule, so they can schedule meetings with me and get some personal tutoring.
## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
## Future Improvements
I intend to add videos to my website for each blog posts to explain the posts better. I also hope to include some form of music students can play while studying the posts. In short, I hope to improve the website, so students can have a better experience; hence, a better understanding.
